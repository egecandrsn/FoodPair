# Recipes Data

Welcome to the "Recipes Data" project! This repository contains a collection of cleaned and tokenized recipe data. Each line represents a different recipe with ingredients separated by commas.

## Overview

Have you ever wanted a convenient and organized dataset of recipes? Look no further! This repository provides you with a collection of recipes that I've meticulously cleaned and tokenized. This makes it easy for you to work with the data in your projects.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure the quality and consistency of the recipe data, I used regular expressions for data cleaning. You can explore the details of this cleaning process in the `recipes_data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook provided in this repository. Understanding the cleaning process can be valuable if you plan to use this data for analysis, machine learning, or any other data-driven tasks.

## Getting Started

If you're ready to dive into the world of recipes, you can start by exploring the data. You can use this dataset for various purposes, such as:

- Analyzing popular ingredients
- Building recommendation systems
- Creating machine learning models for recipe-related tasks

## Data Format

Each line in the dataset represents a recipe, with ingredients separated by commas. You can easily parse and work with this data in your preferred programming language.
